PROJECT ALGORITHM 

A. Array + Linked List → Store list of courses

Each course has:

courseCode  
courseName  
instructor  
day  
time  
prerequisites (optional)


Algorithm:

Use a static array to store fixed courses.

Use a linked list for dynamic additions/removals.

B. Queue → Handle scheduling requests

A request contains:

studentName  
courseCode  
timestamp


Algorithm:

New requests = enqueue

Process next request = dequeue

Display pending requests = iterate queue

C. Stack → Undo last scheduling action

Actions include:

AddCourse  
RemoveCourse  
EnrollStudent  
DropStudent


Algorithm:

After every action, push a record to stack

Undo = pop stack and reverse action

D. Tree → Store subjects alphabetically

Use a simple Binary Search Tree (BST)

Algorithm:

Insert: if subject < root → left, else → right
Search: same logic
In-order traversal → alphabetical order

E. Graph → Represent prerequisite subjects

Courses become nodes.
Prerequisites become edges.

Algorithm:

Use adjacency list

Add edge: Course A → Course B (B is prerequisite)

DFS to check prerequisite chains

Detect cycles (invalid prereq loops)
